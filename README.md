# MultiSeekBar
2D SeekBar with multiple selectable values.

Notice: This project is intended as a study material for creating custom view with touch support and not as a fully functional library.

If you would still like to use it, add the following to your build.gradle file.

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.jitpack:android-example:1.0.2'
}
```
